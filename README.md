## 🌴 Vacationing until august 27

### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on [KorGE 👾](https://github.com/korlibs/korge) a Multiplatform Game Engine for Kotlin and [Korlibs](https://github.com/korlibs/), a set of Multiplaform Libraries for Kotlin.

You can support [KorGE via Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/korgegameengine) you will get access to exclusive content like development coding sessions about korge and other content.

And if you want to support my work directly [you can do it here 🍻](https://github.com/sponsors/soywiz), in addition to helping me continue with my work, you will also get access to development sessions and exclusive tutorials on [my blog](https://soywiz.com/).
